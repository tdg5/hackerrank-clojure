# [Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler002)

## Problem Statement

This problem is a programming version of [Problem
2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) from
[projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/).

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N,
find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Input Format

First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by
T lines, each containing an integer, N.

## Output Format

Print the required answer for each test case.

## Constraints

1 <= T <= 10 ^ 5  
10 <= N <= 4 * 10 ^ 16

## Sample Input

2  
10  
100

## Sample Output

10  
44
